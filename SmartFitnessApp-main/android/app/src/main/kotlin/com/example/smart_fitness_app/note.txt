why is the permission file needed?

health connect requires every app that requests permissions to provide a privacy rationale screen, 
a privay rational screen which users can open from the health connect settings screen.

this file provides that screen.

after adding it run

flutter clean
flutter pub get 
flutter run

health connect permissions will be handled correctly. google health connect compilance requirements for runtime permission rationale. 



next step afterwards, 


when the app starts -> check if the health connect is available.

if it is
    -> ask permission to read steps and heart rate 

    once permission is granted you fetch the daily step count and save it to the supabase.

-add the <activity> and <activity-alias> entries inside AndriodManifest.xml

-create a new file 
android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/smart_fitness_app/OnboardingActivity.kt
